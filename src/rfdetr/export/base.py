"""The exporter interface every export format implements, and the configuration each one takes.

An exporter is constructed from its format's configuration and then called with a prepared
:class:`~rfdetr.export.prepare.ExportGraph`, so the two halves of an export — *what the user asked for* and *what the
model looks like* — stay separate and independently testable.

The base class owns everything that is the same for all seven formats: rejecting a capability the format does not have,
switching the model into its export-friendly forward exactly once, normalizing the returned path, and logging the
result. A format subclass implements :meth:`Exporter._convert` and declares its capabilities as class attributes; it
never repeats a guard.

Configuration is per format rather than one flat object, so a knob that does not apply cannot be passed: there is no
``opset_version`` on ``CoreMLConfig`` to silently ignore. Each format's configuration class lives beside the exporter
that reads it, not here — this module names no format, so adding one touches its own package and the registry rather
than the abstraction they share.
