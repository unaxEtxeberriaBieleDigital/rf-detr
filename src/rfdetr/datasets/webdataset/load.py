"""Load WebDataset shards into RF-DETR streaming datasets and loaders.

Purpose: Read indexed tar shards with RF-DETR transforms and deterministic distributed worker planning. Scope: the
optional WebDataset dependency, iterable dataset, epoch sizing and DataLoader construction. Usage: build a dataset with
build_webdataset and a loader with build_webdataset_loader. Outputs: RF-DETR-compatible dataset samples and DataLoaders.
Failure: rejects missing indexes, incompatible distribution plans and unsupported keypoints. Used by: datasets, detr and

    Two spellings that look right therefore fail on Windows: a bare ``str(path)`` parses ``C:\\shards\\train.tar``

    ``/shards/train.tar`` elsewhere, both of which ``open`` takes as-is. Percent-encoding is deliberately omitted
    for the same reason: nothing downstream reverses it, so a directory containing spaces has to pass through

    """Streaming COCO-style detection dataset reading WebDataset tar shards.

    Yields the same ``(image, target)`` pairs as :class:`~rfdetr.datasets.coco.CocoDetection`: the sidecar JSON goes
    through :class:`~rfdetr.datasets.coco.ConvertCoco` and the result through *transforms*, both inside the DataLoader
    worker that read the shard.

    Sizing follows WebDataset's own convention and has two modes, chosen by :meth:`configure_epoch`:

    - **Unplanned** (the default, and what evaluation uses): every worker drains its own shards exactly once, so the
      split is seen once per epoch with no sample repeated or dropped. The dataset is unsized — ``len()`` raises
      :class:`TypeError`, as it does for any un-lengthed iterable — because the per-worker batch tails make the batch
      count depend on how shards happen to divide across workers.
    - **Planned** (what training uses): every worker yields exactly ``samples_per_worker`` samples, wrapping around
      its own shards if that subset is shorter. The epoch length is then fixed and ``len()`` is exact, which is what
      ``trainer.estimated_stepping_batches`` — and through it the LR schedule — needs. The trade-off is that a
      worker holding fewer shards than average repeats some of its samples within the epoch.

    Args:
        shard_dir: Directory holding the shards and the split's index file.
        split: Split name to read.
        transforms: Transform pipeline applied to ``(image, target)`` after annotation conversion, or ``None``.
        include_masks: Decode polygon/RLE segmentation into binary mask tensors.
        cat2label: ``category_id`` to label-index mapping. ``None`` uses the mapping implied by the shard index.
        shuffle_buffer: Reservoir size for within-shard shuffling; ``0`` disables it.
        shard_shuffle: Shards held in the shard-order shuffle buffer; ``0`` visits shards in packing order.
            Together with *shuffle_buffer* this is the streaming counterpart of ``shuffle=True`` on a map-style
            loader — a local shuffle, not a global permutation.
        seed: Rank-independent base seed for shard order. The loader uses a dedicated generator so rank-local
            random draws cannot change the pre-split permutation; see :meth:`_epoch_seeds`.
        draft_size: Smallest source extent the transform pipeline can consume without upscaling, applied by
            :func:`~rfdetr.datasets.io_utils.decode_image_bytes` the same way the loose-file loaders apply it, or
            ``None`` to decode at full resolution. See :func:`~rfdetr.datasets.coco.draft_size_for_transforms`

    This returns a stock :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` rather than ``webdataset.WebLoader``. ``WebLoader`` is
    a fluid-interface wrapper that *constructs* the very same ``DataLoader`` and then hides it behind a
    ``DataPipeline``, which drops both ``__len__`` and the ``DataLoader`` type. RF-DETR needs the length:
    ``trainer.estimated_stepping_batches`` derives the LR schedule and the drop schedule from it, and ``WebLoader``
    only offers ``with_length()``, which fakes a length without guaranteeing it. The value ``WebLoader`` adds on top —
    post-loader ``unbatched().shuffle().batched()`` rebatching across workers — would break exactly that length
    guarantee. Streaming behaviour is identical either way: it comes from the pipeline inside *dataset*, not from the
    loader class.

    ``webdataset`` is imported here even though the loader itself does not use it, so a missing optional extra fails
    in the main process with an actionable message instead of inside a worker on the first batch.

    Args:
        dataset: The streaming dataset to wrap.
        batch_size: Per-rank micro-batch size.
        collate_fn: Batch collation callable, normally the DataModule's block-size-aware one.
        num_workers: DataLoader worker processes.
        pin_memory: Stage batches in pinned host memory before the device copy.
        persistent_workers: Keep workers alive between epochs.
        prefetch_factor: Batches prefetched per worker, or ``None`` for the DataLoader default.
        worker_init_fn: Per-worker initialisation hook. The CPU augmentation stack draws from NumPy and ``random``,
            which PyTorch does not seed per worker, so this needs the same seeding hook the map-style loaders use.
        fixed_epoch: Plan a fixed-length epoch and drop partial batches. ``True`` for training, where a known length
            drives the LR schedule; ``False`` for evaluation, where every sample must be seen exactly once.
        world_size: Distributed ranks sharing the split. ``None`` reads it from the active process group.
        rank: This process's rank. ``None`` reads it from the active process group. See
            :func:`_fixed_node_splitter` for why the loader resolves this once here rather than letting each
            DataLoader worker re-resolve it independently.
        grad_accum_steps: Micro-batches accumulated per optimizer step. Only used when *fixed_epoch* is ``True``;
            see :func:`plan_samples_per_worker`.
