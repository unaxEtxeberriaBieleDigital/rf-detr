"""Internal one-pass COCO mean-average-precision adapter.

Purpose:
    Isolate RF-DETR's deliberately narrow dependency on TorchMetrics COCO internals and avoid its per-class evaluator
    reruns. The adapter derives compact per-class AP and AR vectors from the aggregate evaluator arrays produced by one
    global evaluation for each requested IoU type.
Scope:
    Own CPU-backed metric updates, validation of the private TorchMetrics state/backend contract, explicit fixed-order
    distributed state merging, update-state inspection, prediction-score hoisting during COCO-format construction, and
    compact one-pass computation. Lightning lifecycle, EMA voting, logging, checkpoint metrics, F1, keypoint
    evaluation, and terminal rendering remain callback concerns.
Usage:
    Import :class:`OnePassCocoMeanAveragePrecision` only from RF-DETR training code. Construct it with one of the
    backends registered in ``_BACKENDS`` (``hotcoco`` by default, ``faster_coco_eval`` or ``ufcoco``) and
    ``sync_on_compute=False``; call ``update`` for each batch, explicitly call ``merge_distributed_state`` at
    rank-symmetric callback sites, then call ``compute``.
Outputs:
    Return the same aggregate, per-class, and class-ID tensor keys consumed from TorchMetrics by RF-DETR. Evaluator
    precision, recall, score, and IoU arrays are reduced immediately and are never returned or retained. One
    deliberate divergence: when an IoU type has no images this pass, :meth:`compute` still emits
    ``*_per_class`` sentinel keys (see :meth:`OnePassCocoMeanAveragePrecision._per_class_sentinels`), whereas
    stock TorchMetrics omits them for that branch; this direction is safe for RF-DETR's callback (it always
    expects the per-class keys to exist) but is not covered by parity tests against upstream for that path.
Failure:
    Reject extended summaries, alternative backends, micro averaging, implicit distributed synchronization, and any
    installed TorchMetrics private layout that differs from the verified contract. These failures are intentional and
    actionable; there is no silent slow fallback.
Used by:
    ``rfdetr.training.callbacks.coco_eval.COCOEvalCallback`` for train, validation/test, and EMA COCO accumulators.

        TorchMetrics' ``_get_coco_format`` hoists boxes and labels to Python lists once per image but reads scores
        one annotation at a time (``scores[image_id][k].cpu().tolist()``, ``helpers.py:563``), which is CPU tensor
        indexing and scalar conversion for every detection because ``update()`` stores detached CPU state. At
        RF-DETR's validation scale that is hundreds of thousands of conversions per ``compute()``. Asking upstream
        for the same annotations with
        ``scores=None`` and assigning per-image score lists afterwards produces byte-identical datasets while
        converting each image's scores once.

        The rewrite needs prediction annotations to appear in state order with no image dropped. Upstream skips an
        image only when it has no masks *and* no boxes (``helpers.py:508-511``), so the hoist is used only when
        boxes are present; a mask-only prediction state falls back to upstream unchanged.

        Args:
            classes: Sorted class IDs observed in predictions or targets, used as COCO category IDs.

        Returns:
            The prediction and target datasets in the order ``_get_coco_datasets`` returns them, followed by the
            COCO-format dictionary the prediction dataset was built from, or ``None`` when it was loaded from a
            detection array instead. That dictionary is returned rather than read back from the dataset because
            hotcoco's ``dataset`` getter is a copy, so the ``area_bbox``/``area_segm`` switch a multi-IoU-type
            evaluation performs would be discarded (hotcoco 0.5 also dropped those non-COCO keys outright; 1.0.0
            preserves them, but a copy is still a copy); ``None`` is safe because the array path is taken only for
            single-IoU-type evaluation, where no area switching happens.

        Raises:
