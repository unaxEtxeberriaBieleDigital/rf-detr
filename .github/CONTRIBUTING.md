> [!TIP]
>
> When contributing, focus on the relevant directory for your change:
>
> - Bug fixes/features → `src/rfdetr/` and `tests/`
> - Documentation → `docs/`
> - CI/build issues → `.github/workflows/` or config files

## Development Environment Setup

RF-DETR uses **`uv`** as the package manager for dependency management. Ensure you have Python >=3.10 installed (supports 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14).

### Installing uv

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rf-detr.git
cd rf-detr

# Create the environment. `uv pip install` installs into an existing virtualenv and
# will not create one for you.
uv venv

# Install the extras and groups the CPU test job uses (add ,coreml on macOS).
# --torch-backend=cpu keeps this from pulling a CUDA build of PyTorch.
uv pip install -e ".[train,augment,cli,visual,data]" --group tests --torch-backend=cpu

# Docs or build work only, without the test extras
uv sync --group docs       # Documentation dependencies only
uv sync --group build      # Build tools only
```

Use `uv pip install` rather than `uv sync` for the test environment. It needs the `uv venv` step above, because unlike `uv sync` it does not create the environment itself. `uv sync` resolves a universal lock across every extra, which fails on extras that declare different Python floors, and `uv sync --all-extras` errors outright because `coreml` and `executorch` are declared as conflicting. `--torch-backend` is also only available for `uv pip`.

The test suite imports the training and augmentation dependencies, so installing dependency groups alone leaves a large number of tests erroring on import.

**Important:** Re-run the install command after pulling changes to ensure your dependencies are up to date.

### Optional Extras

- `rfdetr[data]` installs the WebDataset streaming reader.
- `rfdetr[train]` installs the minimal training loop dependencies and uses torchvision-native default augmentations.
- `rfdetr[augment]` installs Albumentations (custom CPU `aug_config` dictionaries and built-in presets) and Kornia (GPU-side augmentation with `augmentation_backend="gpu"` or `"auto"`).

### Running Tests

> **CI Workflows as Source of Truth:** See `.github/workflows/ci-tests-cpu.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci-tests-gpu.yml` for the exact commands used in continuous integration.

```bash
# Run CPU tests (default for local development; mirrors CI)
uv run --no-sync pytest src/ tests/ scripts/ -n 2 -m "not gpu and not coco17 and not integration and not xla and not tpu" --ignore=tests/run_smoke_all_models.py --ignore=tests/legacy/test_checkpoint_compat.py --cov=rfdetr --cov-report=xml --timeout=420 --durations=50

# Run GPU tests (requires GPU; mirrors CI)
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/ -m "gpu and not e2e_tensorrt" --ignore=tests/legacy/test_checkpoint_compat.py -n 3 --reruns 1 --only-rerun "OutOfMemoryError" --cov=rfdetr --cov-report=xml --timeout=600 --durations=20
```

The marker expressions exclude suites that need assets, optional integrations, or unavailable hardware: `coco17` needs the COCO dataset, `integration` covers tests owned by dedicated integration jobs, and `xla` / `tpu` need accelerators. Dropping them from the expression is what produces most local-only failures.

**Development vs. PR Requirements:**

- **During development:** Tests may fail as you work through TDD cycle (write failing test → implement → fix)
- **Before opening PR:** Your final commit MUST have all tests passing
- **Before each commit:** Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to ensure code quality

### Building the Package

```bash
# Build source and wheel distributions
uv build

# Validate the build
uv run twine check --strict dist/*
```

## Test-Driven Development

We follow test-driven development practices to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### For Bug Fixes

1. **Write a test that replicates the issue** - The test should fail initially, demonstrating the bug
2. **Commit the failing test** (optional during development, but commit message should note "WIP" or "test for issue #XXX")
3. **Implement the fix** - Make the minimal change needed to make the test pass
4. **Verify all tests pass** - Ensure your fix doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Commit the fix** - This commit MUST have all tests passing before opening PR

**Note:** It's acceptable to have failing tests in intermediate commits during development. However, your **final commit before opening a PR must have all tests passing**. This aligns with test-driven development: first create a failing test that proves the bug exists, then fix it.

### For New Features

1. **Write tests covering all major use cases** - Think about edge cases, invalid inputs, and expected behaviors
2. **Implement the feature** - Build the feature to satisfy the test requirements
3. **Refactor if needed** - Clean up the implementation while keeping tests green

### Test Organization

**Use test classes to group related tests:**

```python
import pytest


class TestModelInference:
    def test_single_image_inference(self):
        # Test code
        pass

    def test_batch_inference(self):
        # Test code
        pass
```

**Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to extend test cases:**

Use `pytest.param(..., id="name")` (instead of a separate `ids` list) when a case passes a function, object, or compound setup as one parameterized item, when it needs a per-case pytest mark, or when the raw value would produce an unclear/empty ID (e.g., `""`). Use bare string, number, boolean, and `None` values otherwise; avoid parallel `ids` lists for simple types.

```python
import pytest


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "model_variant",
    ["nano", "small", "medium"],
)
def test_model_loading(model_variant):
    # Test code that runs for each model variant
    pass
```

**Avoid multiple validation cases in a single test:**

Do not write tests that loop through multiple cases internally. Instead, use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` so each case runs as a separate test:

```python
import pytest
from rfdetr.assets.model_weights import ModelWeights


# BAD: Multiple cases in one test - all assertions must pass for test to pass
def test_all_models_have_valid_urls():
    for model in ModelWeights:
        assert model.url.startswith("http")  # Hard to identify which model failed


# GOOD: Parametrized - each model is a separate test case
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "model",
    [pytest.param(model, id=model.filename) for model in ModelWeights],
)
def test_all_models_have_valid_urls(model):
    assert model.url.startswith("http")  # Clear which model failed
```

Benefits of parametrization:

- Each case runs as an independent test (failures are isolated)
- Test IDs clearly identify which case failed
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Better test reporting in CI

**Mark GPU-required or computationally heavy tests:**

```python
import pytest


@pytest.mark.gpu  # Use this marker for GPU-dependent or heavy tests (e.g., training)
def test_model_training():
    # Training test code
    pass
```

Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.gpu` are excluded from CPU CI workflows and run separately on GPU infrastructure.

**Use dedicated markers for integration-only CI jobs:**

Mark tests that require an optional integration dependency with both the shared `@pytest.mark.integration` marker and a registered `e2e_<integration>` marker in `pyproject.toml`. The dedicated workflow must select the specific marker (for example, `pytest -m e2e_onnxruntime`) rather than a test-file path; generic CPU collection excludes only `integration`, keeping its marker expression short while dedicated jobs retain their precise contracts.

### CI Testing

> [!NOTE]
>
> **CI Workflows (Source of Truth):** See `.github/workflows/ci-tests-cpu.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci-tests-gpu.yml` for exact commands.

Our continuous integration tests run on:

- **Operating Systems:** Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Python Versions:** 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
- **CPU Workflow:** `pytest -m "not gpu"` - Runs on Ubuntu for every Python version above, and on Windows and macOS for Python 3.10 and 3.13
- **GPU Workflow:** `pytest -m gpu` - Runs separately on GPU infrastructure

This ensures your changes work across all supported platforms and Python versions.

**Legacy checkpoint compatibility is advisory only.** `ci-legacy-checkpoints.yml` is not among develop's required status checks (`Test docs build`, `pre-commit.ci - pr`, `testing-guardian`, and `Testing`). The required `Testing` job invokes pytest with `--ignore=tests/legacy/test_checkpoint_compat.py`, so it excludes legacy tests. Branch-protection required-check configuration is repo-admin config outside this PR's diff. This is a deliberate advisory-only tradeoff: a legacy-compatibility failure, including an intentional future checkpoint-format break, does not block merge.

**Key GitHub Actions workflow files** (in `.github/workflows/`):

- **ci-tests-cpu.yml** — CPU tests on Ubuntu across Python 3.10–3.14, plus Windows and macOS on Python 3.10 and 3.13
- **ci-tests-gpu.yml** — GPU-dependent tests
- **ci-legacy-checkpoints.yml** — Backward-compatibility checkpoint-loading tests across historical rfdetr releases (advisory only — not a required check; a compat break does not block merge)
- **build-package.yml** — Build and validate distributions (`uv build` + `twine check`)
- **ci-build-docs.yml** — Documentation build validation
- **publish-docs.yml** — Deploy docs to GitHub Pages on release

**Concurrency:** PRs cancel in-progress runs on new pushes.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests with parallel execution (recommended)
uv run --no-sync pytest src/ tests/ scripts/ -n 2 -m "not gpu" --ignore=tests/run_smoke_all_models.py --ignore=tests/legacy/test_checkpoint_compat.py --timeout=240 --durations=50

# Run a specific test file
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/models/test_model.py

# Run a specific test
uv run --no-sync pytest tests/models/test_model.py::test_model_loading
```

## Code Quality and Linting

All code must pass linting and formatting checks before being merged. We use **pre-commit hooks** to automate this process.

> [!TIP]
>
> Pre-commit hooks will auto-format many issues. If pre-commit fails, review the changes it made and re-stage the files.

### Setting Up Pre-commit

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Configuration:** See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for all hooks and `pyproject.toml` for tool-specific settings (e.g., `[tool.ruff]`).

## Deprecation Policy

RF-DETR uses [pyDeprecate](https://github.com/Borda/pyDeprecate) to emit structured deprecation warnings. Use `@deprecated` for functions and methods, `@deprecated_class` for classes. The importable package name is `deprecate` (not `pyDeprecate`); refer to its docs for advanced usage.

```python
from deprecate import deprecated


@deprecated(target=new_fn, deprecated_in="1.10.0", remove_in="1.13.0")
def old_fn(*args, **kwargs): ...
```

**Rules:**

- All version strings must be full semver: `1.7.0`, not `1.7`.
- Classify every deprecation when it is introduced:
    - **Major-impact deprecations** — broad or incompatible public changes must remain until the next major release. For example, a symbol deprecated in `1.x` has `remove_in="2.0.0"`.
    - **Minor deprecations** — routine API, argument, configuration, or rename migrations use a 0.3 release-cycle window. A symbol deprecated in `X.Y.0` has `remove_in="X.(Y+3).0"`; for example, `1.10.0` removes in `1.13.0`.
- Every new deprecation needs an entry in `docs/getting-started/migration.md` under a `### Deprecated in vX.Y → Remove in vX.Z` subsection. State the tier when the removal target alone could be ambiguous.

**Removal checklist** (when `remove_in` version arrives):

1. Delete the deprecated symbol, class, or shim file.
2. Remove any remaining `@deprecated` / `@deprecated_class` decorators.
3. Add a breaking-change entry to `docs/getting-started/migration.md`.
4. Search for lingering imports of the removed symbol and update them.
5. Verify `pre-commit run --all-files` passes and tests are green.

## Building Documentation

RF-DETR's documentation is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. API reference pages are auto-generated from docstrings using [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Building the full documentation locally requires the `plus` extra (`rfdetr[plus]`), which provides the XLarge and 2XLarge model pages. Without it, the build will fail on those reference pages.

### Install Documentation Dependencies

```bash
# Full docs build (matches CI — required for XLarge/2XLarge model pages)
uv pip install -e ".[plus]" --group docs

# Minimal install (skip plus models — XLarge/2XLarge pages will error)
uv sync --group docs
```

### Serve Locally with Live Reload

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. The server watches for file changes and reloads automatically — no restart needed as you edit documentation.

### Build Static Site

```bash
# Build static documentation site to the site/ directory
uv run mkdocs build
```

**Note:** `mkdocs.yaml` uses custom YAML tags (`!!python/name`). The `check-yaml` pre-commit hook runs with `--unsafe` to allow this — do not remove that flag.

### Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── index.md              # Home page
├── learn/                # How-to guides and tutorials
│   ├── install.md
│   ├── run/              # Detection and segmentation guides
│   └── train/            # Training guides (parameters, augmentations, loggers, etc.)

```

> [!TIP]
>
> When adding a new documentation page, add it to the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yaml` so it appears in the site navigation. Pages that exist in `docs/` but are not listed in `nav` will not be included in the site.

## CLA Signing

In order to maintain the integrity of our project, every pull request must include a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This confirms that your contributions are properly licensed under our Apache 2.0 License. After opening your pull request, simply add a comment stating:

```
I have read the CLA Document and I sign the CLA.
```

This step is essential before any merge can occur.

## Google-Style Docstrings and Mandatory Type Hints

For clarity and maintainability, any new functions or classes must include [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and use Python type hints. Type hints are mandatory in all function definitions, ensuring explicit parameter and return type declarations.

Document constants with `#: explanation` immediately above the assignment, not standalone triple-quoted strings. Keep docstrings for modules, classes and functions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Type hints are in the function signature. **Do not duplicate types in docstrings** - describe the parameter's purpose instead.

For example:

```python
def sample_function(param1: int, param2: int = 10) -> bool:
    """
    Provides a brief description of function behavior.

    Args:
        param1: Explanation of the first parameter's purpose.
        param2: Explanation of the second parameter, defaulting to 10.

    Returns:
        True if the operation succeeds, otherwise False.

    Examples:
        >>> sample_function(5, 10)
        True
    """
    return param1 == param2
```

Following this pattern helps ensure consistency throughout the codebase.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This applies to helper functions inside `tests/` too, not just `src/`. Any non-`test_*` function used as a test fixture/builder (e.g. `_make_checkpoint`, `_random_xyxy_boxes`) needs a docstring with an `Examples` doctest that exercises it directly — a small, fast check that the helper still does what its callers assume. `pyproject.toml`'s `--doctest-plus` runs doctests across `tests/` for exactly this reason (see the comment above `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`). Skip the live doctest (`# doctest: +SKIP` with a one-line reason) only when the helper cannot run standalone — e.g. it is a `@pytest.fixture` (pytest now hard-fails on direct fixture calls) or needs real GPU/XLA/network hardware.

## Reporting Bugs

Bug reports are vital for continued improvement. When reporting an issue, please include a clear, minimal reproducible example that demonstrates the problem. Detailed bug reports assist us in swiftly diagnosing and addressing issues.

## Adding a New Model

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Before implementing a new model, **discuss with maintainers first**. Project structure and patterns are subject to change.

**General workflow:**

1. **Open an issue** describing the proposed model and approach
    - You may ask maintainers to confirm the expected evaluation protocol (dataset, metrics) before running full benchmarks
2. **Demonstrate improvement** versus reference models on a standard public dataset (e.g., COCO val2017)
    - If the change is for an existing RF-DETR model, show a case where the new approach is Pareto optimal (e.g., better accuracy at similar or lower latency/model size) over the existing model
    - If the change is adding a new functionality, show a case where the new approach is Pareto optimal over comparable third-party models (see the [README model table](../README.md) for reference baselines)
    - Provide a script for us to reproduce your results
3. **Wait for maintainer feedback** on architecture and integration approach
4. **Follow test-driven development:**
    - Write comprehensive tests for the new model
    - Implement the model following approved approach
    - Ensure all tests pass
5. **Add documentation** as directed by maintainers
6. **Submit PR** with reference to the discussion issue

Maintainers will guide you on specific files to modify and patterns to follow based on current project architecture.

## Security Considerations

- **Write secure code:** Avoid injection vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, command injection)
- **Validate inputs:** Especially for file paths, URLs, and user-provided data
- **No credentials:** Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials to the repository
- **Follow OWASP best practices** for any user-facing or network-facing code
