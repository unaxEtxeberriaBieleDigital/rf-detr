# RF-DETR: Real-Time SOTA Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Keypoint Detection

RF-DETR is a real-time transformer architecture for object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection (preview) developed by Roboflow. Built on a DINOv2 vision transformer backbone, RF-DETR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy–latency trade-offs: RF-DETR-L reaches 56.5 AP50:95 on COCO at 6.8 ms (NVIDIA T4, TensorRT FP16), and RF-DETR-2XL achieves 60.1 AP50:95 — the first real-time model to exceed 60 AP on COCO. Accepted at [ICLR 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09554).

RF-DETR uses a DINOv2 vision transformer backbone and supports object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection (preview) in a single, consistent API. Core models (Nano through Large) and all code are released under the Apache 2.0 license; XL and 2XLarge detection models require `rfdetr[plus]` and are provided under PML 1.0.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is RF-DETR?** RF-DETR (Roboflow Detection Transformer) is a real-time object detection and instance segmentation model from Roboflow, accepted at ICLR 2026. It uses a DINOv2 vision transformer backbone and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy–latency trade-offs on COCO (60.1 AP50:95 for RF-DETR-2XL) and RF100-VL.

**How does RF-DETR compare to YOLOv11?** RF-DETR-L achieves 56.5 AP50:95 on COCO at 6.8 ms latency on an NVIDIA T4, outperforming YOLOv11x (50.9 AP) at lower latency. The DINOv2 backbone gives RF-DETR stronger performance on domain-shift benchmarks such as RF100-VL.

**What GPU is required to train RF-DETR?** A CUDA-capable GPU with at least 8 GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3060, T4, A10) is recommended for fine-tuning. Smaller models (RF-DETR-N and RF-DETR-S) can fit in 6 GB VRAM with reduced batch size. CPU inference is supported for evaluation.

**Which dataset formats does RF-DETR support?** RF-DETR supports COCO JSON and YOLO-format datasets (with `dataset_file: "yolo"`). Roboflow datasets export directly to both formats. Detection and segmentation datasets use the same format — the model variant determines the task.

**Can RF-DETR run in real time?** Yes. RF-DETR-N runs at 2.3 ms per frame on a T4 GPU (TensorRT FP16, batch 1), and RF-DETR-L at 6.8 ms — both well within real-time thresholds. ONNX, TFLite, TensorRT, ExecuTorch, CoreML, and OpenVINO exports are available for edge deployment.

**What is the difference between RF-DETR detection and segmentation models?** Detection models (e.g., `RFDETRLarge`) output bounding boxes. Segmentation models (e.g., `RFDETRSegLarge`) additionally output instance masks. Both share the same backbone and training API; segmentation adds a mask head and requires COCO-format segmentation annotations.

**Does RF-DETR support keypoint detection?** RF-DETR Keypoint (Preview) detects 17 body keypoints per person on COCO, achieving 71.8 AP50:95 at 9.7 ms on NVIDIA T4. It is available in the `rfdetr` package as `RFDETRKeypointPreview`. See [Run Keypoint Models](learn/run/keypoints.md) for usage.

**Is RF-DETR open source?** Yes. Core models (Nano through Large) and all training/inference code are released under the Apache 2.0 license. XLarge and 2XLarge models require the `rfdetr[plus]` package (PML 1.0 license).

**How do I fine-tune RF-DETR on a custom dataset?** Instantiate a model and call `model.train(...)` with your dataset directory in COCO JSON or YOLO format. Example: `model = RFDETRLarge(); model.train(dataset_dir='./dataset', epochs=50, batch_size=4)`. The model downloads pretrained weights automatically and saves best checkpoints automatically (use `resume=` to continue from one).

**How do I export RF-DETR to ONNX or TensorRT?** Call `model.export(format="onnx")` after training or loading a checkpoint. ONNX export works on CPU and produces a single `.onnx` file compatible with ONNX Runtime and OpenCV DNN. For TensorRT deployment, use `model.export(format="tensorrt")`, which exports ONNX and then builds a `.trt` engine in-process via the TensorRT Python API; this requires `pip install rfdetr[tensorrt]` and a CUDA GPU.

**Which RF-DETR model size should I use?** RF-DETR-Nano (2.3 ms, 67.6 AP50 on COCO) is best for edge and real-time applications. RF-DETR-Large (6.8 ms, 56.5 AP50:95) offers the best accuracy–latency trade-off for server deployment. RF-DETR-2XLarge (17.2 ms, 60.1 AP50:95) maximizes accuracy when latency allows.

> **Checkpoint note:** Current `RFDETRLarge` defaults to `rf-detr-large-2026.pth`. The older `rf-detr-large.pth` checkpoint is a legacy Large release kept for backward compatibility and has been superseded by the current release.
